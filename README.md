## code editor looking developer resume

Hello,

You can use the source code that generates the website showing my resume from the json file I created for my personal website dynamically by doing the following for yourself.

### Files That Need to Be Edited

*   /data/detail.json: You should enter your own personal information in this file in json format.
*   /images/avatar.jpg: You should replace this file with your own photo. (When you update this file, all text areas on your site will be updated as well) That's all :)

_Php is required._
